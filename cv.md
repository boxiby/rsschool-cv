### About me
As a Front-End Developer I created different 
websites using CMS and HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
to built the sites.
I recently created and optimized the ARC France 
distributor's online store with 3000 products. Today, 
the site brings new visitors 15-20 thousand per month 
and more than 2000 keywords take the top 5 of 
Google and Yandex.
Now I am studying intensively and plan to expand my 
knowledge in full stack.
In my free time you can find me in the swimming pool 
or outdoor walking. On weekends I like to arrange car 
trips to new places with my family and friends.
